# Solved Rosalind Problems

This Repository showcases my progress on the website Rosalind.info. 

Rosalind is a website similar to Hackerrank, Edabit or Leetcode, In which questions and problems are provided for the individual to solve. 
While the problems are relatively simple, and require little time and effort to solve, i notice the difficulty increasing dramatically.

Working on these projects has been a very beneficial experience - While my other projects help me write, understand and think code in a better manner, utilising Rosalind allows me 
to integrate my past knowledge of Genomic data and apply it in an algorithmic sense; in addition, i am able to get a better understanding of the type of work a Bioinformatican would undertake.
