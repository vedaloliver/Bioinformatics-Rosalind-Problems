# Worked Rosalind Problems

This Repository showcases my progress on the website Rosalind.info.
Working on these projects is a very interesting experience - While my other projects help me write, understand and think code in a better manner, utilising Rosalind allows me 
to integrate my past knowledge of Genomic data and apply it in an algorithmic sense.

While i have only completed a few of these challenges, the algorithms presented are proving to be exceedingly challenging, yet rewarding when a solution is found!
